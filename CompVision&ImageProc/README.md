Exercise on ComputerVision and Image Processing. 

This program is activated when the camera cuptures a frame difference but it uses the pixels that overcomes the threshold. 
Then the pixels are used to difine the frequency of the sinewave and also the processing of the Image (blur in RGBThreshold)
