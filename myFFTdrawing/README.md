Exercise on FFT Analysis and the use of this for sound visualization. 

using the key 1 on the keyboard we can draw with an FFT Brash where the different values of the octave avarages of the sound the are drawn appart from eachother and not with the same center like in option 1 (default). 

FFT values are influencing the values of the color of the box that it's been drawing as well.
